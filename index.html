        <p>The Aravalli Hills, one of the world’s oldest mountain systems, stretch approximately 670 km from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat, forming a crucial ecological and geographical barrier in northwestern India.  Estimated to be around 2 billion years old, the range predates the Himalayas and originated during the Proterozoic Era, making it a vital geological record of early Earth processes.  It acts as a natural shield against the eastward expansion of the Thar Desert, stabilizing climate, recharging groundwater, and supporting biodiversity across the region.  The range divides Rajasthan into arid northwestern zones and fertile southeastern regions, while also serving as a watershed for major rivers like the Chambal, Banas, Luni, Sabarmati, and Sahibi, which sustain agriculture, settlements, and wetlands.  Despite heavy erosion over millennia, the Aravalli Hills remain ecologically significant, hosting protected areas such as Sariska Tiger Reserve, Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary, and Jhalana Leopard Safari Park, and supporting diverse flora and fauna including tigers, leopards, wolves, and migratory birds.  In late 2025, the Supreme Court of India issued a landmark ruling establishing a uniform definition: a landform must rise 100 metres or more above local relief to be classified as an Aravalli Hill, and two or more such hills within 500 metres of each other constitute an Aravalli Range.  This definition, aimed at strengthening ecological protection, includes supporting slopes and intervening valleys, ensuring the integrity of the entire ecosystem. The Court imposed a moratorium on new mining leases until a comprehensive Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) is developed, emphasizing strict regulation of existing mining, protection of core habitats, and the creation of a 5-km Aravalli Green Wall to restore degraded land across 29 districts.  While the government asserts over 90% of the Aravalli region remains protected, the new criteria have sparked nationwide concern and protests under the #SaveAravalli movement, highlighting the tension between development and conservation. </p>
